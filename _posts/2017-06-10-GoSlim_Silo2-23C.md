To simplify the number of GO terms and make it easier to compare the enrichment over time, I am going to use the online tool https://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/util/gotreen and input the text files from the [CompGO results](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-pacific.oyster-larvae/tree/master/DDA_2016/Compgo_results). This will categorize the GO terms into larger categories- GO Slim. When using the tool I selected count consolidated single occurances for each of the runs. 

To start off I just followed Silo 2-23C throughout development. Here are [screenshots](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-pacific.oyster-larvae/tree/master/DDA_2016/GO_slim) of all of the results.

I entered all the data in excel found [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-pacific.oyster-larvae/blob/master/DDA_2016/Compgo_results/CompGOSilo2.xlsx) so I could make my own plots. Here is [one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobertsLab/project-pacific.oyster-larvae/master/DDA_2016/GO_slim/Silo2-23C.JPG) I made:
