title: Skyline 2015 oyster seed experiment
---

07/03/17

I will be getting back into Skyline to analyze 2015 oyster seed experiment results.

I had to redownload the program and did so here: https://skyline.ms/project/home/software/Skyline/begin.view

I downloaded the version 3.7- 64bit

Since I had already done some work on this project back in October I am picking up where I left off.

Here is my [skyline output file](https://github.com/Ellior2/Fish-546-Bioinformatics/blob/master/analyses/taylor/proteomeoutput.csv) from before. It contains CGI_... codes.
