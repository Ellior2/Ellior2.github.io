I took lists of the total proteins detected in samples 27, 28 and 32 and imported them into Galaxy to make a Venn diagram of shared proteins at Day 9

Using the enrichment tool provided by Emma and linked to in previous posts, I created plots in excel. In Box 1 I copied the list of proteins from Sample 27 (Silo 2-23C at Day 9) with an NSAF expression level of at least 100. For Box 2 I copied the list of proteins from Sample 32 (Silo 9-29C at Day 9) with an NSAF expression level of at least 100. I downloaed the report instead of creating visuals this time. This way I am able to make plots in Excel.

Here is a plot for [Biological Processes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobertsLab/project-pacific.oyster-larvae/master/DDA_2016/Qspec27.32/BioProcesses27.32.JPG). The X- axis represents P-value so shorter the bar (or lack thereof) the more significant the association is. Orange bars represent Silo 9-29C at Day 9 and blue bars represent Silo 2-23C at Day 9.
