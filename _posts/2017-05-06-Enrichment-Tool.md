Emma sent me a link to an enrichment tool developed by Mike Riffle. See [Github post](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/issues/601)

And the [tool](http://www.yeastrc.org/compgo_oyster/pages/goAnalysisForm.jsp)

For the first trial I copied a list of all the detected CHOYP... proteins for Sample 27 (Silo 2-23C at Day 9) in Box 1 and all of the detected CHOYP proteins for Sample 32 (Silo 9-29C at Day 9) in Box 2. 

For the GO aspect: Cellular component

P-value cutoff: 1E-1

Analysis type: Image

Here is the [output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ellior2/Ellior2.github.io/master/images/EnrichmentCell27.32ALL.png)
