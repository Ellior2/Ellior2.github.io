### For the Sonication

_Preliminary Steps_

I pre-labeled 22 snaptop centrifuge tubes with the number assigned to each sample we will run. I also pulled the 22 samples we will run out of the main box and put them in a seperate labeled box in the -80C freezer.

First thing in the morning I will make 20ml of the 50mM NH4HCO3 in 6M Urea. To do so I will add 20ml of nanopure using a glass graduated cylinder into a 45ml falcon tube. Then I will weigh out 79.06mg of NH4HCO3 and add to the falcon tube and vortex to dissolve. Next I will weight out 7.21g of Urea and add this to the falcon tube. Again vortex to dissolve.

Go get dry-ice from Health Sciences J-Wing. Find a cooler and tongs to bring with you.

_Sonication Process_

Obtain the 22 samples out of box in the -80C and place in rack.

Add 500ul of the 50mM NH4HCO3 + 6M urea solution to each of the 22 samples. Always work in numerical order to make sure the timing of each of these steps is as similar as possible for each sample. Begin homogenizing each sample with a clean blue plastic pestel. When all 22 samples have been homogenized place them in the centrifuge set at 2000xg for 5 minutes.

After the centrifuge step, pipette out 100ul of supernatant liquid from each sample and put into the newly labeled centrifuge tubes accordingly. Discard pipette tip each time. Should I save the remaining sample in the -80C? 

Make an ethanol dry ice bath. Are there any special considerations here? Just add ethanol to dry ice in a beaker?

Make a wetbath. Get ice and add water. Place a test tube rack to store samples in between sonications.

It seems like the sonication really warms up a 100ul sample quickly. We may want to reduce to 5s or less of sonication, then 5s in ethanol/dry ice bath, then in wet bath between sonications. Will the sample refreeze in the ethanol/dry-ce bath and is that bad? I will start with first sample and cycle through the whole series before starting on the second round of sonications. Repeat for a total of three sonication rounds.

Place all of these samples back in the -80C for protein quantification at a later time.
