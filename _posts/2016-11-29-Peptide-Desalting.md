### Desalting

__For this procedure you will need:__

1) Solvent A = 60% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid

2) Solvent B = 5% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid

3) Macrospin columns (Sample capacity: 0.03-300ug, Elution volume 50-150ul, Bed volume 300ul)

#### Procedure

1) Reconstitute samples by adding 100ul of Solvent B. Adjust pH to less than 2 using 10ul of 10% formic acid at a time. (Last time we ended up using 100ul of 0.1% and 70ul of 10% formic acid.)

2) Prepare macrospin columns by adding 200ul Solvent A to each column. Spin for 2000 rpm for 3 minutes (repeat 3 times for a total of 4 times). Discard remaining liquid at the bottom of tube everyother addition to accomodate room for next round.

3) Equilibrate columns by adding 200ul Solvent B to each column. Spin for 2000 rpm for 3 minutes (repeat 2 times for a total of 3 times). Again discard remaining liquid at the bottom of tube each time to accomodate room for next round.

4) Load protein onto column by pipetting all of the sample onto column. Spin at 3000rpm for three minutes. Collect the liquid at the bottom of the tube and put back on the column for a second round. Your peptides are now in the columns. 

5) Wash salts through column by adding 200ul Solvent B and spinning at 3000 rpm for three minutes (repeat twice for a total of 3 times). Save remaining liquid at the bottom of each tube by transferring it to a new labeled tube (just in case).

6) Transfer columns to clean collection tubes. Add 100ul Solvent A, spin at 300 rpm for 3 minutes (repeat once for a total of 2 times). Keep this liquid as it contains your peptides!

7) Evaporate samples to near dryness (room temp is ok).

8) Reconstitute peptides in 100ul 3% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid. Aliquot 15 ml of sample into autosampler vial. Place both leftover samples and autosampler vials in -80C.
