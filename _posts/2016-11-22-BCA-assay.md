### BCA assay for Protein Quantification

##### To make reagents:

__BCA Working reagent__

Since we have 7 standards and 22 samples, each requiring 200ul of working reagent, we will make about 6ml total.

(8 standards + 22 samples)x(3 replicates)x(200ul)= 18,000ul or 18ml working reagent required

The working reagent is made with a ratio of 50 parts BCA reagent A with 1 part BCA reagent B. Therefore, I will pipette 20ml of Reagent A to a 45ml falcon tube and then add 400ul of Reagent B for a total of 20.4ml solution. Vortex.

__50mM NH4HCO3__

I will also need 22ul of 50mM NH4HCO3 per sample but will go ahead a make a 10ml solution to strive for accuracy.

MW: 79.06 g/mol

(79.06g/mol)x(1mol/1,000mmol)x(50mM/1L)x(1L/1,000ml)x 10ml = .03953g of NH4HCO3 in 10 ml.

_Add 5ml of nanopure to 10ml falcon tube. Add 0.03953g of NH4HCO3 and vortex to dissolve. Add solution to graduated cylinder and top off to 10ml. Pour back into falcon tube._

__Lysis Buffer__

Take 4ml of the 50mM NH4HCO3 you just made put it into a 10ml falcon tube. I will add Urea to make 6M solution. Since we will dilute 2:1 with nanopure the extra volume at this point due to added Urea will not matter after dilution.

MW: 60.06g/ml

(60.06g/mol)x(6mol/L)x(1L/1000ml)x 4ml = 1.44g Urea to add to 4 ml of 50mM NH4HCO3

_Vortex to dissolve and add to graduated cylinder. Top off volume to 6ml total. Pour back in falcon tube._

Vial H (0.025ug/ml BSA concentration):
Add 400ul of Lysis Buffer to 100ul Vial G dilution

Vial I (0ug/ml) BSA concentration):
Add 400ul of lysis buffer


##### BCA assay microplate protocol:

1) Go get 22 samples ready for analysis out of the -80C. Each sample should have 11ul.

2) Add 22ul of 50mM NH4HCO3 to each sample for a total volume of 33ul.

3) Make three replicates. Pipette 10ul of each sample into three labeled microplate wells. Repeat for the remaining 21 samples.

4) Make three replicates for each BCA standard. Pippete 10ul of each standard into three labeled microplace wells.

5) Add 200ul of working reagent to each well.

6) Cover plat and incubate at 37C for 30 minutes

7) Cool plate to room temperature. Measure the absorbance at or near 562nm on plate reader.
