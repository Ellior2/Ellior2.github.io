## BCA assay for Protein Quantification

#### To make reagents:

__BCA Working reagent__

We have 8 standards and 22 samples to run with 3 replicates for each (90 total). Each replicate requires 200ul of working reagent.

(8 standards + 22 samples)x(3 replicates)x(200ul)= 18,000ul or 18ml working reagent required

The working reagent is made with a ratio of 50 parts BCA reagent A with 1 part BCA reagent B. Therefore, I will pipette 20ml of Reagent A to a 45ml falcon tube and then add 400ul of Reagent B for a total of 20.4ml solution. Vortex.

__50mM NH4HCO3__

I will also need 22ul of 50mM NH4HCO3 for each of the 22 samples.

MW: 79.06 g/mol

(79.06g/mol)x(1mol/1,000mmol)x(50mM/1L)x(1L/1,000ml)x 10ml = 0.03953g of NH4HCO3 in 10 ml.

_Add 5ml of nanopure to 10ml falcon tube. Add 0.03953g of NH4HCO3 and vortex to dissolve. Add solution to graduated cylinder and top off to 10ml. Pour back into falcon tube._

__Lysis Buffer__

Take 4ml of the 50mM NH4HCO3 you just made put it into a 10ml falcon tube. Add Urea to make 6M solution. Since we will dilute this solution 2:1 with nanopure, the extra volume at this point due to added Urea will not matter since we are diluting afterwards.

MW: 60.06g/ml

(60.06g/mol)x(6mol/L)x(1L/1000ml)x 4ml = 1.44g Urea to add to 4 ml of 50mM NH4HCO3

_Vortex to dissolve and add to graduated cylinder. Top off volume to 6ml total. Pour back in falcon tube._

#### BCA assay microplate protocol:

1) Go get the 22 samples ready for analysis out of the -80C. Each sample has 11ul.

2) Add 22ul of 50mM NH4HCO3 to each sample for a total volume of 33ul. Vortex to mix. Then centrifuge down.

3) Make three replicates for each BCA standard. Pipette 10ul for each replicate into the corresponding microplate wells (see table).

4) Create three replicates for each sample. Pipette 10ul for each replicate into the correspondeing microplate wells (see table).

5) Add 200ul of working reagent to each well.

6) Cover plate and bring it over to the Genome Sciences building.

7) Insert microplate into spectrophotometer. Label cells in computer. The computer will incubate the samples for 30min at 37C and then shake the microplate to mix reagents. It will measure the absorbance at 562nm.

8) Subtract the average 562nm absorbance measurement for the Blank Standard Replicates from the 562nm measurements of all the other standard and sample replicates.

9) Prepare standard curve by plotting average Blank-corrected 562nm measurements for each BSA standard vs. it's concentration in ug/ml. Use standard curve to determine protein concentration of each unknown sample.
