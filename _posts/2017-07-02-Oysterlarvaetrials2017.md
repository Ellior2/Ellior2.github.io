title: Oyster larvae trials 2017
---

07/02/17

At the Taylor Shellfish hatchery we have been having trouble producing enough Pacific oyster larvae to supply our farms. For the past few months, we have seen that the larvae just stop growing after about Day 6. Their digestive glands are empty and they are not actively swimming. In one case, we saw 100% mortality (empty shells by Day 8).

We have been experimenting with different treatments, food, and water supplies to try and rule out different factors influencing survival. In the last experiment we found that larvae reared in two different locations within the hatchery performed much better than in the high-density flow through room where we rear all of our production oysters. In this experiment, we are further testing the idea that there might be some issue with water quality in the production resevoir. There are three locations we are growing larvae. The control conicals in each location refer to larvae being supplied with the water that normally is pumped to that system.

__New Greenhouse:__
- Conical 1 and 2 are being supplied with water from the production resevoir.
- Conical 3 and 4 are being supplied with "control" water coming from Molly's system in the NGH.

__Duck Room:__
- Conical 1 and 2 are being supplied with water from the production resevoir.
- Conical 6 and 7 are being supplied with "control" water which comes directly out of the treatment tank.

__Production Room:__
- Conical 41 and 42 were being supplied with "control" water until Day 3 when the temperature was steadily increased to 28C.
- Conical 45 and 46 are being supplied with water directly out of the treatment tank (In other words, the water is not coming from the normal path using the production resevoir)
- Conical 47 and 48 are being supplied with control water (Production resevoir)

This experiment should allow us to tease out certain factors that may contribute to the high mortality we are seeing. Hobos were placed in the conicals 7/1/17

_Histology_
I will fix samples in 10% formalin for Ralph. At the same time I will sample larvae using PaxGene.

_Proteomics_
Samples will be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in -80C.

_Microbiomes_
I will use 5um, 0.7um, and 0.22um to capture potential protozoans and bacteria.
