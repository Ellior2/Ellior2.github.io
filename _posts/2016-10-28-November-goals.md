## Work on Skyline output for 2015 oyster data:
- Determine coefficient of variation for the retention times for each peptide across oyster replicates.
- Determine error by choosing 100 random peptides and counting how many times Skyline incorrectly matched peaks or did not get entire peak area in the peak picking borders.
- Learn MS stats (R-based package) to figure out differentially abundant peptides and proteins and make some nice plots. 

## Finalize wiki pages for experiments and begin a discussion with Steven, Emma, and Brooke regarding which samples we want to analyze for the 2016 experiments
